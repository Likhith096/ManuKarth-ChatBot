          "answer": "You can open the custom_partitions_example.cfg file in a text editor and specify the partitions you want for the admin node. Typically, you write the configuration file to an NFS server at your site. Use an existing server. A later procedure explains how to specify the location to the installer at boot time. Alternatively, you can write the configuration file to the installation media, but this requires assistance from Hewlett Packard Enterprise."
